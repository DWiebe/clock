This is a personal project using C to program an Arduino Atmega2560.

My personal goal is to gain experience in coding embedded systems.

My goals/milestones for this project are:
- Create an accurate "analog" clock using stepper motors.
- Add a digital (7 segment) display that also shows the time.
- Allow a user to adjust the time using an infrared remote.
- Allow a user to set and disable an alarm.

Due to limited access/interest in hardware, the final result will likely not look
like an actual clock. I only have one stepper motor, but I may get more. If I do
end up getting more steppers, I have no good way of aligning them such that each
hand of the clock can be in the center. I will, however, include wiring diagrams
for my project.

The focus of this project is the software, so I don't mind if the final product
looks "ugly".
